## Problem Statement :

You are given an integer array `A` of size `N`, sorted in non- decreasing order. You are also given an integer `target`. Your task
is to write a function to search for 'l`target` in the array `A`. If it
exists, return its `index in 0-based indexing` using Linear Search in
C++/Python/Java.
